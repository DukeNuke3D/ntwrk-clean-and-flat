# ntwrk-clean-and-flat
Free 2D symbols for computer network diagrams based on https://github.com/ecceman/affinity - clean and flat, easily customizable in native Visio stencil format

## Why
Wanted same "modern, crisp, pixel-perfect, printable, manufacturer independent symbols for computer-network topology that does not look like they were made in the 80s"(c) but made in native Visio format to let you easily change color or entire stencil in a fast and convenient way without using additional tool. These stencils are not imported SVGs, but re-drawn from scratch.
New stencils are added on as-needed basis so do not expect to see all the icons from https://github.com/ecceman/affinity, but you can find out some additional which were missing there.
